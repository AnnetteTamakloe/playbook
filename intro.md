# Welcome to the Data Science Playbook

Learning how to code in Python can be very confusing, especially when you don't know where to start. 
The goal of this blog is to give you all the insight I wish I had when I first began learning how to code, particularly in the Data Science realm. 
We'll start from scratch by first creating good ecosystems to encourage you to actually finish projects, nail down the python basics necessary for project building and then explore key concepts in the Data Science Life Cyle through tutorials.
