# Welcome to the Data Science Playbook

You shouldn't learn how to code by coding. You should learn how to code by building projects. Projects kill two birds with one stone. They give you insight into important concepts in your field of interest and force you to come up with interesting strategies to deal with the challenges you'll inevitably face when you code. Though this is the best way to expand your knowledge, it's hard to know where to start. 
This blog's aim is to give you all the insight I wish I had when I first began learning how to code, particularly in the Data Science realm. We'll start from scratch, by first creating a good ecosystems to encourage you to actually finish projects and then gradually explore interesting Data Science concepts.
