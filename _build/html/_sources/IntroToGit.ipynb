    "### What is Git?\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a program you can run from the command line. it comes pre-installed on all Linux based machines and Macbooks. If you have a Windows PC you have to download it. Programmers use git so that they can keep a history of all changes made to their code. This means that they can roll back changes as far back as when they started using git with their project. Folders in git are referred to as a **repository**, or **repo**, for short. Directories, repositories, and folders pretty much mean the same thing in the world of programming.\n",

    "**For Windows**  \n",

You can share folders on your computer publically and make it available for all to see and potentially use. Its the perfect place to show your work, track your projects/code and collaborate with other people interested in programming. Before moving forward, join the programming geekdom and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account."
